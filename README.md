# A minimalist MIPS 32 Core



This project is a simple MIPS32 bits core described in Verilog to help students into learning about computer architecture.


# Instructions to implement actually:

- LW/SW - Load and Store Words

- ADD/SUB - Arithmetical Operations

- AND,OR,XOR,NOT - Logical Operations
- Jump and Branch Instructions


# Tools

To implement and debug mips core, we used these tools:

- Icarus Verilog
- Gtk wave



# Todo
- Alu
- Alu Controller
- Multiplexers
- Define a interface between mips and memory (Data memory and program memory)
- Connect all modules


#done

- Finally i'm created a folder only for source code :)
